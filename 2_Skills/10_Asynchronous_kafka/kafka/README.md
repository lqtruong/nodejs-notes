# Kafka events in Nodejs

This chapter is to implement the scaling applications using Kafka message broker as the main communication

Steps 
- to install `@hapi/hapi`
- to install connector to mongodb (in this example, we try to use `mongodb` using [`mongoose`](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) instead of `sqlite3`)
- to install `kafkajs` as client side to produce & consume messages

# Scenario + Architecture
# Start HAPI server
# Router
# Handlers
# Producer
# Consumer
